# Consensus Building Patterns

## Pattern 1: Convergent Agreement

**Scenario**: Crew members start with different positions but find common ground through the cypher.

**Indicators**:
- Initial positions differ significantly
- Responses show acknowledgment of valid points
- Final verse shows modified positions
- Shared recommendations emerge

**Synthesis approach**:
```
All crew members ultimately agree that [common conclusion].
While they approached from different angles:
- [Model A] emphasized [perspective A]
- [Model B] highlighted [perspective B]
The convergence suggests high confidence in the conclusion.
```

## Pattern 2: Principled Disagreement

**Scenario**: Fundamental differences remain but are well-understood.

**Indicators**:
- Positions remain distinct through all rounds
- Disagreements are value-based or assumption-based
- Each position is internally consistent
- Trade-offs are clearly articulated

**Synthesis approach**:
```
Crew members maintain distinct positions based on different priorities:
- If [priority A] matters most: [recommendation A] (supported by [models])
- If [priority B] matters most: [recommendation B] (supported by [models])
The choice depends on the specific context and constraints.
```

## Pattern 3: Expert Consensus

**Scenario**: One model has domain expertise others defer to.

**Indicators**:
- One model provides significantly more detailed analysis
- Other models cite or build on that analysis
- Challenges are on specifics, not fundamentals

**Synthesis approach**:
```
The cypher converged around [expert model]'s analysis.
Key insight: [main point]
Other crew members validated and extended this with:
- [Additional point 1]
- [Additional point 2]
```

## Pattern 4: Synthesis Breakthrough

**Scenario**: Cypher generates novel insight none had initially.

**Indicators**:
- Final positions differ from initial ones
- New perspective emerges from interaction
- "Building on" language is common
- Mutual learning is evident

**Synthesis approach**:
```
Through the cypher, a new understanding emerged:
[Novel synthesis]
This combines:
- [Element from Model A]
- [Element from Model B]
- [Element from Model C]
```

## Pattern 5: Irreconcilable Difference

**Scenario**: No consensus possible due to fundamental incompatibility.

**Indicators**:
- Positions remain unchanged
- Arguments talk past each other
- Different frameworks/assumptions
- No common evaluation criteria

**Synthesis approach**:
```
Crew members hold incompatible views due to different [frameworks/values/assumptions].
Position A: [description] - based on [framework A]
Position B: [description] - based on [framework B]
Recommendation: [Further analysis needed / Choose based on context / Escalate to stakeholders]
```

## Confidence Assessment

### Strong Consensus (80%+ agreement)
- Clear majority or unanimous position
- Well-reasoned arguments
- Challenges were addressed
- Recommendation: State as firm recommendation

### Moderate Consensus (50-80%)
- Majority position exists
- Some valid counterarguments
- Trade-offs acknowledged
- Recommendation: Present with caveats

### Weak Consensus (<50%)
- No clear majority
- Multiple valid positions
- Significant uncertainty
- Recommendation: Present options, not recommendation

### No Consensus
- Irreconcilable differences
- Fundamental disagreement
- Different evaluation criteria
- Recommendation: Explain why, suggest next steps

## Handling Edge Cases

### One Model Dominates
If one model's responses are significantly longer/more detailed:
- Ensure other voices are still represented in conclusion
- Note the imbalance in analysis
- Consider if domain expertise explains it

### Model Contradicts Itself
If a model changes position without explanation:
- Note the shift
- Try to identify what caused the change
- Use the more considered position

### Circular Arguments
If cypher loops without progress:
- Identify the sticking point
- Call for resolution
- Accept disagreement if needed

### Off-Topic Responses
If a model diverges from the topic:
- Redirect in next prompt
- Use only relevant portions
- Note limited contribution
